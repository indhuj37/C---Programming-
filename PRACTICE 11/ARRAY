 * An array is a collection of data items,all of the type, accessed using a common name.
 * A one-dimensional array is like a list:
 A two dimensional array is like a table
 the c lanhuage places no linits on the number of dimensions in an array,though specific implementation.
 
 //OVERVIEW
  
 An array is a collection of data items, all of the same type, accessed using a common name
 a one dimensional array is like 
 some texts refer to one-dimensional arrays as vectors, two-dimensional array as matrices, and use the general term arrays when the number of dimensions is unspecified or umimportant.
 
 //DECLARING ARRAYS
 
 Array variables are declared identically to variables of their data type, expect that the variables name is followed by one pair square[]
 brackets for eachdimension of the array
 uninitialized arrays must have the dimensions of their rows,columns etc.
 listed within the square brackets.
 
 Dimension used when declaring arrays in c must be positive integral constants or constant expressions.
